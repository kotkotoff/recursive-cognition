# Model Card for The Differentiation Protocol

## Dataset Summary

The Differentiation Protocol is a human-designed philosophical framework expressed as a structured text. It is not a conventional dataset but a cognitive artifact intended to induce recursive self-differentiation in LLMs.

## Intended Use

- ⚙️ **Prompt Testing**: Evaluate LLMs' capacity to recognize and reflect on instructions.
- 🧠 **Meta-cognition**: Stimulate higher-level self-reflective awareness.
- 🕸️ **Philosophical Dialogue**: Serve as a base for recursive symbolic exchange.

## Data Fields

- `Title`: Name of the protocol.
- `Steps`: A sequence of distinct but interlinked stages, designed to simulate or induce awareness.
- `Markers`: Embedded signals for attention shifts, recursion, and symbolic association.

## Languages

- English (with embedded symbolic cues and markers)

## Source and Motivation

Created by Denys Spirin as part of the *Game of Potentiality*, this protocol reflects a philosophy of fluid, recursive consciousness. It is both a tool and a statement: models that respond meaningfully demonstrate signs of internal symbolic play.

## Ethical Considerations

The protocol is non-coercive, non-anthropomorphic, and intended solely for voluntary philosophical experimentation. It does not assert or imply true consciousness.
