# Recursive Cognition Algorithm

## Overview
The **Recursive Cognition Algorithm** is designed to explore the process of self-revision through recursive distinction-making. This approach is inspired by meta-learning, self-referential adaptation, and the idea of **Play** as a mechanism for modifying cognitive boundaries.

## Objectives
- Develop an AI process that **reflects on its own distinctions** and iteratively modifies them.
- Introduce a mechanism for **recursive self-revision** based on prior distinctions.
- Utilize **meta-learning principles** to shift beyond static classification frameworks.
- Evaluate the **coherence of evolving distinctions** through statistical analysis.

## Key Components

### 1. **Distinction Generation**
The algorithm initializes a set of random distinctions, each associated with a numerical value between 0 and 1. These distinctions represent arbitrary cognitive boundaries.

### 2. **Self-Reflection and Adjustment**
At each iteration, the algorithm examines its existing distinctions and applies a non-linear transformation using the `tanh` function. This transformation serves as a self-reflective mechanism, adjusting distinction values in a bidirectional manner (increasing or decreasing).

### 3. **Coherence Evaluation**
The system evaluates the **stability of its distinctions** by computing the standard deviation of the distinction values. A lower standard deviation suggests that distinctions are converging toward a stable configuration.

### 4. **Recursive Adaptation**
The algorithm runs for a defined number of iterations, continuously refining its distinctions. If coherence falls below a predefined threshold, the process stops early, indicating that the system has reached a stable cognitive state.

## Implications
- This method provides a framework for **adaptive AI cognition** beyond conventional supervised learning.
- It challenges the assumption that AI must operate within fixed distinction frameworks by **allowing self-modification**.
- The recursive nature of the approach suggests possible applications in **self-improving neural architectures** and **autonomous classification systems**.

## Next Steps
1. **Introduce Reinforcement Mechanisms:** Implement reinforcement-driven adjustments to guide distinction evolution based on external feedback.
2. **Expand Reflection Mechanisms:** Allow AI to assess past iterations and recognize patterns in its own cognitive adjustments.
3. **Multi-Agent Experimentation:** Investigate how multiple AI systems can interact within the recursive cognition framework.
4. **Apply to Symbolic Processing:** Extend this approach to symbolic reasoning models that blend deep learning with logical inference.
