Recursive Cognition Algorithm

This algorithm is designed to recursively reflect on distinctions and self-revise its own classification boundaries.
The approach is inspired by meta-learning and the philosophy of Play as a mechanism for self-adaptation.

Core Features:
- Iteratively modifies its own categorization rules
- Uses meta-learning principles to adjust based on prior iterations
- Self-referential reflection on classification accuracy
- Dynamic self-awareness threshold for adaptive reflection
